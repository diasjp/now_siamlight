As ServiceNow currently does not really support a github merge feature there is only one way of contributing properly.

- Fork you branch
- Develop / change / modify in your branch
- Once you know what to change post an issue here and document your changes and the use case

I will check the issue and code changes. If not conflicting and well documented I will incorporate them manually in the master branch. Afterwards you will need to resync your branch for next changes.
